Hi for the people who are reading this.


this is my current challenge of the Flutter Platform.

My first impressions, Its like Java but less of the Editing platform that Netbeans Provided (currently using VS Code for my Editing).

It could have been helpful if we have a layout or program where we can poosition items with a Layout editor. But i guess true code is the way to go.

Hopefully with this challenge i could get better. We'll see how far we can go. So help me God!
